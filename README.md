# Amazon-Sales-Data-Prediction
*Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my project on Amazon sales data analysis! As part of my internship with unified mentor, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into analyzing sales data. Predicting the variables that effects on sales, total revenue, total cose and etc.

In this project, I used Python to analyze Amazon sales data and created visualizations to better understand trends and patterns. I also used machine learning algorithms to make predictions about future sales.

I had a great time working on this project and learned a lot in the process. I hope it inspires you to dive into data analysis and explore the insights that can be gained from it.
